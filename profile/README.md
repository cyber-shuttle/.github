## Hi there 👋

**Balance Local and Remote for Streamlined Research with Cybershuttle**

Cybershuttle expertly balances local and remote computing, seamlessly orchestrating tasks and data between machines. Schedule time-sensitive, small tasks locally, and reserve compute-intensive tasks for powerful remote HPC resources, with data transparently accessible everywhere. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency of scientific workflows compared to fully remote or fully local operations.

Cybershuttle is built upon the Airavata middleware.
