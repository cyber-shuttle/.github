## 👋 Cybershuttle - Unified Research Across Local, Cloud, and HPC

Cybershuttle effortlessly connects your laptop, cloud resources, and supercomputers into one streamlined research environment. Run quick analyses locally, seamlessly offload intensive simulations to remote HPC clusters, and have your data automatically flow where you need it. No rewriting code. No manual transfers. Just smoother, faster science.

By intelligently optimizing task placement and data movement, Cybershuttle accelerates computational workflows beyond what purely local or remote solutions can achieve.

Powered by [Apache Airavata](https://github.com/apache/airavata), Cybershuttle empowers researchers with a unified, friction-free computing experience.
